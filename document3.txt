After 4 months , we came to know about our interest in men and he claimed that he fell in love with me on the first day he saw me. He asked me on a date and I said yes , That went amazing . After dating for another month , i proposed him and he cried in joy . We moved in togather in my appartment and turned his appartment into an office for our startup.
